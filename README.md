# Java Blueprint Interface

> An Unreal Engine plugin to interact with the Android Java VM from Blueprints.

## Unreal Engine Marketplace
The plugin is still in development and is not available yet.  

## How it works
The plugin uses the Google Mobile Ads SDK of the target platform internally to display native ads. A simple yet complete API is available for both Blueprints
and C++ to seemlessly implement ads with Unreal Engine without bothering about platform-specific details.  
All functionalities are available without limitation for Blueprints and / or C++.

## Features
- Call Java methods from Blueprints.
- Call Blueprint methods from Java.
- Use any Java library directly from Blueprints.
